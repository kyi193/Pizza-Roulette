# Pizza Roulette üçïüçïüçï
Sometimes it's really tough to choose a pizza place because of the sheer amount of restaurants that exists.
Pizza Roulette aims to fix this by first randomly selecting eight of the best pizza restaurants in your location and then narrowing them down to one choice.

This app relieves the stress of second guessing yourself, lets you carry on with your day, and focus on what's really important: eating pizza.
